## Setting up project

1. Clone the repo first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/7dp/WichReactNativeStarter.git
```

2. Remove unwanted folders and init a brand new repo:

```
git clean -xfd;
rm -rf .git;
git init;
```

3. Rename your newly created project:

```
npx react-native-rename YourProjectName
```

4. Rename the Android package-name if you want:

```
npx react-native-rename YourProjectName -b <com.package.name>
```

For iOS you can use XCode to rename the bundle-id.

5. And don't forget to recheck your android project structure inside `android/app/src/main/java` and make sure it is correct.

## Running

Start Metro server by running:

```
yarn start
```

Running on iOS requires you to install the pod first:

```
yarn pod
```

You can run Android and iOS by pressing `a` and `i` on your Metro server respectively.
